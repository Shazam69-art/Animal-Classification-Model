# Animal-Classification-Model
Animal Classification using MobileNetV2 trained on 15 classes with data augmentation, achieving 93.5% validation accuracy over 50 epochs. Implemented with TensorFlow/Keras and served via a Flask-based web interface.
There are two things in the zip file which is the trained file and the interface script. Copy and paste the model path in the script file and make sure that you launch the interface after you see the http flask link in the terminal.
